Justify-content:

This property controls how flex items are distributed along
the main axis of the flex container.The main axis is determined
by the 'flex-direction' property(either horizontal or vertical)


Common values for "justify-content" include:

"flex-start": items are packed at the start of the main axis

"flex-end": Items are packed at the end of the main axis

"center":Items are centered along the main axis.

"space-between": Items are evenly spaced with the first 
item at the start and the last item at the end,and the remaining space 
space distributed between them.

space-around: items are evenly spaced with equal space around the item

"space-evenly":Items are evenly spaced with equal space around
and between them.


2 align-items:

This property determines how the items inside a 
flex container are aligned along the cross axis(vertical 
axis by default).

Values include 'flex-start', 'flex-end','center','stretch',
and 'baseline'. These values control the vertical alignment
of flex items within the container.

3. gap:

The 'gap' property specifies the space between flex items
in a flex container.it sets the margin between adjacent items,
both horizontally and vertically.

it can take a single value for equal spacing in both directions
or two values(e.g., 'gap':10px 20px;)to set different horizontal and 
vertical gaps.

4. 'flex-direction': This property determines the direction
in which flex item are placed within the flex container.
it defines the main axis and the direction of item placement.

Values include 'row'(default, left to right),'row-reverse'
(right to left) 'column' (top to bottom) and 'column-reverse(bottom to top).

5. 'flex-wrap':
 1. The 'flex-wrap' property controls whether flex-items should
 wrap to the next line when they don't fit within the container
 available space along the main axis.

 values include 'nowwrap'(default, no wrapping)
'wrap'(item wrap onto new lines afs needed), and 'wrap-reverse'
(items wrap onto new lines in the opposite direction).
